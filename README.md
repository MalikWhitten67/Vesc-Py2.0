# Vesc-Py2.0

## About Vesc-py
Vesc py a lib created by me, this was originally designed to be for a project, involving my custom ebike which uses the vesc platform. I wanted to make a display for it, however pyvesc was outdated and had a bunch of errors. I decided to look deeper into the vesc serial and engineer a frontend to make life simple in retrieving live values.


## How to use
Simply clone the repo, download the zip and import `vesc.py` if you want to dable into getting these values on the frontend `index.py` allows you to tap into retrieving values via websocket!
